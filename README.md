# Bayesian Calibration of the 40K Decay Scheme
This repository contains python code and data to run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algoritum for the estimation of posterior distributions for all 4 modes of potassium-40 decay and the total potassium-40 decay constant. 

This algorithm is a framework in the manuscript - Bayesian calibration of the 40K decay scheme with implications for 40K-based geochronology. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (2025) - Carter, J.N., Hasler, C.E., Fuentes, A.J., Tholt, A.J., Morgan, L.E. and Renne, P.R.


This work is a combined effort from the 40Ar/39Ar lab-group at the Berkeley Geochronology Center (BGC) and discussion and collaboration with Leah Morgan (USGS).
